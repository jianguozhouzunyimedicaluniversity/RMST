Description: Functions for three different approaches are provided in this
    package. The three approaches are calculating the area under the Kaplan-Meier
    curve, using pseudovalues with a Generalised Estimating Equation, and fitting
    a Royston-Parmar model and calculating the area under the predicted survival
    curves. Each method takes a different approach at calculating the RMST and have
    their own merits.
